Thanks for your interest in contributing!
This is a volunteer-driven hobby project and we welcome contributions.

## Ways to Contribute

- Bug fixes
- New features
- Documentation improvements
- Bug reports

## Developing

See [developing.md](./developing.md)

## Guidelines for Pull Requests

- Keep PRs focused on a single change
- Write clear commit messages
- Add tests for new functionality, or to cover against regressions
- Remember to update documentation

## Filing Issues

Before creating an issue:
- Search existing issues to avoid duplicates
- Use a clear, descriptive title

For bug reports, include:
- Steps to reproduce
- Expected vs actual behavior
- Your environment (OS, version, etc.)

For feature requests:
- Describe the problem you're trying to solve / your usecase
- Explain your proposed solution

## AI/LLM Generated Code

We accept the use of AI tools to assist with development,
but all code must meet the same quality standards regardless of how it was created:

- You must review and **understand** all code
- Code must be tested and verified to work correctly
- Follow the project's existing patterns and conventions
- AI-generated code is not an excuse for lower quality
- Code must be minimal to solve the problem at hand
- Code must be simple, readable and easy to maintain

You are responsible for any code you submit, regardless of its origin.
Pull Requests that do not demonstrate sufficient attention to quality,
will be rejected.

## Code of Conduct

Be respectful and constructive.
We're all here to learn and build something useful together.
