	abstract = {Industrial assets often feature multiple sensing devices to keep track of their status by monitoring certain physical parameters. These readings can be analyzed with machine learning ({ML}) tools to identify potential failures through anomaly detection, allowing operators to take appropriate corrective actions. Typically, these analyses are conducted on servers located in data centers or the cloud. However, this approach increases system complexity and is susceptible to failure in cases where connectivity is unavailable. Furthermore, this communication restriction limits the approach’s applicability in extreme industrial environments where operating conditions affect communication and access to the system. This paper proposes and evaluates an end-to-end adaptable and configurable anomaly detection system that uses the Internet of Things ({IoT}), edge computing, and Tiny-{MLOps} methodologies in an extreme industrial environment such as submersible pumps. The system runs on an {IoT} sensing Kit, based on an {ESP}32 microcontroller and {MicroPython} firmware, located near the data source. The processing pipeline on the sensing device collects data, trains an anomaly detection model, and alerts an external gateway in the event of an anomaly. The anomaly detection model uses the isolation forest algorithm, which can be trained on the microcontroller in just 1.2 to 6.4 s and detect an anomaly in less than 16 milliseconds with an ensemble of 50 trees and 80 {KB} of {RAM}. Additionally, the system employs blockchain technology to provide a transparent and irrefutable repository of anomalies.},

The traditional approach utilizing the centralized schema of recognition system has its main disadvantage concluding a high traffic and computing load of the central processing server: the more video surveillance cameras are served by the central unit, the more its load rate. But most of the time the high-quality video stream does not consist of facial information and the computational resources are being wasted. The main principle of our recognition system is the distributed hierarchical processing network utilizing the "coarse-fine" paradigm. Each source video stream is processed in-place by the tiny {SoC} computer which acts as an Edge Computing Unit and detects the presence of a face fragment in a video frame and crops the bounds of the {ROI}. The resulting stream including {ROI} is relayed to the main server if the face is detected.},

As questions asked of behaviour and brain activity become more sophisticated, the ability to specify and run richly structured tasks becomes more important. An increasing focus on reproducibility also necessitates accurate communication of task logic to other researchers. To these ends, we developed {pyControl}, a system of open-source hardware and software for controlling behavioural experiments comprising a simple yet flexible Python-based syntax for specifying tasks as extended state machines, hardware modules for building behavioural setups, and a graphical user interface designed for efficiently running high-throughput experiments on many setups in parallel, all with extensive online documentation. These tools make it quicker, easier, and cheaper to implement rich behavioural tasks at scale. As important, {pyControl} facilitates communication and reproducibility of behavioural experiments through a highly readable task definition syntax and self-documenting features. Here, we outline the system’s design and rationale, present validation experiments characterising system performance, and demonstrate example applications in freely moving and head-fixed mouse behaviour.},

Early identification of diseases in coffee plantations is crucial for productivity and production quality. Two datasets were used, in addition to images taken with the development board itself, totaling more than 6000 images of six different types of diseases. The proposed architectures (cascade and single-stage), when embedded, presented accuracy values around 98\% and 96\%, respectively, demonstrating their ability to assist in the diagnosis of diseases in coffee farms, especially those managed by producers with less resources.},

	abstract = {The rapid growth of the Internet of Things ({IoT}) and its applications requires high computational efficiency, low-cost, and low-power solutions for various {IoT} devices. These include a wide range of microcontrollers that are used to collect, process, and transmit {IoT} data. {ESP}32 is a microcontroller with built-in wireless connectivity, suitable for various {IoT} applications. The {ESP}32 chip is gaining more popularity, both in academia and in the developer community, supported by a number of software libraries and programming languages. While low- and middle-level languages, such as C/C++ and Rust, are believed to be the most efficient, {TinyGo} and {MicroPython} are more developer-friendly low-complexity languages, suitable for beginners and allowing more rapid coding. This paper evaluates the efficiency of the available {ESP}32 programming languages, namely C/C++, {MicroPython}, Rust, and {TinyGo}, by comparing their execution performance. Several popular data and signal processing algorithms were implemented in these languages, and their execution times were compared: Fast Fourier Transform ({FFT}), Cyclic Redundancy Check ({CRC}), Secure Hash Algorithm ({SHA}), Infinite Impulse Response ({IIR}), and Finite Impulse Response ({FIR}) filters. The results show that the C/C++ implementations were fastest in most cases, closely followed by {TinyGo} and Rust, while {MicroPython} programs were many times slower than implementations in other programming languages. Therefore, the C/C++, {TinyGo}, and Rust languages are more suitable when execution and response time are the key factors, while Python can be used for less strict system requirements, enabling a faster and less complicated development process.},
